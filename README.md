# Rethinking Asynchronous Programming (JavaScript)

A repo for notes and examples from the Rethinking Asynchronous Programming course on PluralSight by Kyle Simpson

## Parallel vs Async

Parallel: Threads executing work at the same time.

Example: Virtual cores managed by an OS.

Async: Single thread

Concurrency: Two, higher-level operations are occurring at around the same time.

## Async Patterns

* Callbacks (Continuations)
* Thunks
* Promises
* Generators/Coroutines
* Observables (Event Reactives)
* CSP (channel-oriented concurrency)

## Callbacks (Continuations)

## Thunks

## Promises

## Generators

## Observables (Event Reactives)

* RxJS

## CSP (Channel-Oriented Concurrency)

Examples of CSP usage: `Golang`
